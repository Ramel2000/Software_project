## Application for Galeries Lafayette

As a freelance developer, I created a custom application for **Galeries Lafayette** on boulevard Haussmann. 
The application was designed to process an Excel file and provide visualizations of the foot traffic in various sections of the department stores. 

### Key Features:
- **Excel File Import**: The application accepts Excel files containing store data, including information on customer traffic.
- **Data Visualization**: It generates clear and intuitive visualizations to help store managers analyze and monitor foot traffic in different sectors of the stores.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with ease of use in mind, allowing non-technical staff to easily operate the tool.

This project was designed to improve decision-making and operational efficiency by providing insights into customer behavior and store crowd dynamics.
